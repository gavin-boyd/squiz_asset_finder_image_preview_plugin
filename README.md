#Squiz Matrix EES Image Preview Plugin - v1.0

###Dependencies

1. Squiz Matrix
2. Squiz Matrix Easy Edit Suite

###Setup

1. include eeplus-image-preview.js at the bottom of your EES head code
2. then call setThumb('http://www.yoursite.com');

###Planned updates and improvements

This still requires a click interaction for image preview.  The plugin will be improved to add inline image preview, which does not require the click interaction.  This will allow large lists of images with thumnails beside the image asset title.
